# Contribution Guide

Outlined in this section are the guidelines for contributing to WATERWATCH.

## Requirements Installation
To avoid having to run individual installation commands, run:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements/dev-requirements.txt
```

## Documentation Guidelines
For python files, [numpy documentation style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) must be used.

For files containing typescript, [TypeDoc style](https://typedoc.org/) must be used.

## Style-checking
To ensure consistent code style, contributors will need [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) installed. This can be done by running
```bash
python -m pip install ruff==0.11.8
```
To style-check code, run:
```bash
ruff check --fix
ruff format
```

## Pre-commit
For additional code style checking, contributors must ensure that [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is installed. This can be done via the installation of `dev-requirements` or by running
```bash
python -m pip install pre-commit
```
After pre-commit is installed, to create the commit hook:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
This makes sure that the pre-commit hooks will be run before commiting.
